Here we look at how interaction can \"dress\" a particle giving a total mass different than its bare mass. As a consequence, we see that the size of the particle becoming zero does not cause its mass to become infinite. The Mach's principle takes into account interactions of all the particles in the universe to give the inertial mass.\n",
